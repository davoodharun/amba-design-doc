# Executive Summary

In today's rapidly evolving cloud environment, maintaining visibility and control over Azure resources has become increasingly complex. Organizations moving to Azure often struggle with establishing consistent monitoring practices across their cloud resources, facing challenges such as manual alert configuration, inconsistent monitoring standards, and the complexity of managing alerts at scale. These challenges can lead to missed incidents, delayed responses, and increased operational overhead.

Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA) emerges as a comprehensive solution to these challenges, offering organizations a structured and automated approach to monitoring their Azure environments. By providing a policy-driven framework that automatically deploys and manages alert rules across your Azure environment, AMBA transforms how organizations approach Azure monitoring. Through Azure Policy integration, AMBA ensures that every resource is monitored according to best practices while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to specific organizational needs.

## Key Benefits

When implementing AMBA, your organization gains several strategic advantages:
- Automated deployment of alert rules significantly reduces manual configuration effort
- Policy-driven approach ensures consistent monitoring standards across your Azure estate
- Flexible customization of thresholds and configurations while maintaining governance control
- Suitability for both small deployments and enterprise-scale implementations
- Seamless integration with existing Azure infrastructure, particularly within Azure Landing Zone architecture
- Alignment with broader governance and compliance requirements
- Support for operational needs across different environments, from development to production
