### Infrastructure Monitoring Dashboard

The Infrastructure Monitoring Dashboard focuses on monitoring the health and performance of your infrastructure components. This dashboard includes metrics for CPU and memory utilization, network performance, and storage capacity, helping you maintain a robust infrastructure.

### Custom Dashboard Creation

Creating custom dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana involves selecting the most relevant metrics and visualizations for your needs. This includes configuring data sources, creating panels, and setting up alerts to ensure you have a comprehensive view of your environment.

## Dashboard Templates

Dashboard templates provide a starting point for creating effective dashboards. AMBA offers pre-built templates that you can customize to meet your specific needs.

### Alert Overview Template

The Alert Overview Template is designed to provide a clear view of your alert status. This template includes sections for active alerts, alert trends, and resolution times, helping you manage and respond to alerts effectively.

### Performance Dashboard Template

The Performance Dashboard Template focuses on visualizing performance metrics across your Azure environment. This template includes panels for CPU utilization, memory usage, and network performance, helping you optimize resource usage.

## Visualization Best Practices

Creating effective visualizations involves following best practices that enhance clarity and usability. This section explores key principles for designing dashboards and visualizations.

### Design Principles

Design principles guide the creation of effective dashboards. Consider organizing information logically, creating clear visual hierarchies, and adding interactive elements to enhance usability. This includes using appropriate chart types, color coding, and layout options to present data effectively.

### Data Presentation

Data presentation involves choosing the most relevant data to display and presenting it in a clear and actionable manner. This includes selecting key performance indicators, configuring alert displays, and including business impact metrics.

## Custom Visualizations

Custom visualizations allow you to create unique and effective ways to present your monitoring data. This section explores how to create custom charts and visualizations that provide insights into your environment.

### KQL Queries

KQL queries enable you to extract and analyze data from your Azure environment. This includes creating custom metrics, filtered views, and aggregations that provide insights into your monitoring data.

### Metric Visualizations

Metric visualizations involve creating charts and graphs that represent your monitoring data effectively. This includes selecting appropriate chart types, configuring data sources, and setting up interactive elements to enhance usability.

## Dashboard Management

Managing your dashboards involves regular updates and maintenance to ensure they continue to provide valuable insights. This section explores key aspects of dashboard management.

### Access Control

Access control ensures that your dashboards are accessible to the right users. This includes configuring permissions, managing user roles, and ensuring that sensitive data is protected.

### Version Control

Version control helps you manage changes to your dashboards effectively. This includes tracking updates, managing configurations, and ensuring that your dashboards remain consistent with your monitoring strategy.
